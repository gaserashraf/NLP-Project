# NLP-Project
We all witnessed the COVID-19 pandemic and realized how such a global pandemic
has changed many perspectives in our daily lives. One of the most important ways to
determine how individuals are affected by such a pandemic is by collecting what they
are saying about it. Social media platforms such as Twitter represent a very rich source
of peopleâ€™s opinions and feelings.
During the release of COVID-19 vaccines, people had different opinions about these
different vaccines. Some people stand with these vaccines seeing that they are the way
to get rid of the virus. Others believed that all these vaccines are useless or may be
harmful. Also, these tweets contain different contents (e.g. rumors, advice, information
authentication, etc.)
In this project, you will be provided with labeled Arabic tweets that are related to
COVID-19 vaccinations. Your task is to build NLP models to detect the stance toward
vaccination and the content type of the tweet. Stance detection is the task of detecting
whether the author of a piece of text is in favor of the given target or against it.
